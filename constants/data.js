        description: [
            `I’ve always been drawn to the creative process, whether it’s through painting dreamlike landscapes or crafting intuitive user experiences in software. My journey into web development started as a passion project: I wanted to build a website to showcase my artwork. But as I dived deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I realized that coding felt just like painting, each element carefully placed, each function a brushstroke bringing a vision to life.`,
            `The more I learned, the more I wanted to push my limits. After six months of self-study, I sought a more structured approach and enrolled in Thinkful’s Software Engineering program, where I thrived under its rigorous curriculum. I mastered React, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, all while developing a problem-solving mindset that carried over to my technical support roles.`,
            `I’ve been fortunate to use the skills I’ve learned in my SaaS technical support career, helping businesses troubleshoot and resolve complex issues. I’ve worked with APIs, debugging tools like Kibana, and ticketing systems like Zendesk and Salesforce to investigate problems, improve workflows, and ensure seamless customer experiences. Whether it's analyzing logs, debugging integrations, or simplifying technical concepts for users, I enjoy being the bridge between technology and people.`,
            `Outside of work, I love playing video games, practicing mindfulness, hiking, working out, reading, and building silly little projects. I’m always looking for new ways to grow, whether it's through exploring new technologies or challenging myself with creative pursuits.`,
