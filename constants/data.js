        description: [
            `Once upon a time, I wanted to paint the world, not just with colors, but with ideas, with logic, with the intangible magic that brings things to life. I started with brushes and canvases, dreaming up landscapes that didn’t exist, but something was missing. I wanted my creations to move, to breathe, to interact.`,
            `So I turned to the web.`,
            `What began as a simple desire to build a website for my artwork quickly spiraled into something much greater. HTML and CSS were like a sketchbook, each line shaping my vision, but then JavaScript came along and whispered, What if this could do more? The more I learned, the more I realized that coding wasn’t so different from painting, each function and element a carefully placed stroke in a larger masterpiece.`,
            `Eager to refine my craft, I embarked on a structured journey with Thinkful’s Software Engineering program, where I immersed myself in React, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. The problem-solving, the thrill of debugging, the satisfaction of seeing something broken turn whole again, it all felt like a puzzle waiting to be solved.`,
            `Then came the world of technical support and SaaS, where I became a bridge between technology and people. I untangled API mysteries, navigated debugging tools like Kibana, and danced through support platforms like Zendesk and Salesforce, guiding users through the labyrinth of software issues. Here, I discovered a new joy, helping others make sense of the things that confused them.`,
            `And then, in 2024, I stumbled upon AI.`,
            `It was an accident, really, a chance opportunity to train AI models. But the moment I started, I was hooked. AI was a new kind of canvas, one where logic met language, where creativity blended with algorithms. As an AI Training & Quality Analyst, I assessed AI-generated responses, ensuring they were accurate, ethical, and aligned with human expectations. I delved into Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), sculpting the nuances of AI reasoning. My curiosity led me deeper, and soon, as an AI Data Specialist, I was crafting structured prompts, testing AI’s ability to adapt, and simulating intricate, multi-turn interactions.`,
            `Somewhere along the way, I realized that everything I love, art, problem-solving, storytelling, building, refining, has been woven into this journey. Whether I’m coding, troubleshooting, or training AI, the thrill is the same: taking something raw and shaping it into something remarkable.`,
            `When I’m not tinkering with technology, you’ll find me playing video games, hiking through nature, practicing mindfulness, working out, or simply building silly little projects for fun. Growth is my compass, and I’m always chasing new horizons.`,
            `So here I am, an artist, a builder, a dreamer, and a perpetual student of the unknown. And the best part? The journey’s just getting started.`,
            // `I’ve always been drawn to the creative process, whether it’s through painting dreamlike landscapes or crafting intuitive user experiences in software. My journey into web development started as a passion project: I wanted to build a website to showcase my artwork. But as I dived deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I realized that coding felt just like painting, each element carefully placed, each function a brushstroke bringing a vision to life.`,
            // `The more I learned, the more I wanted to push my limits. After six months of self-study, I sought a more structured approach and enrolled in Thinkful’s Software Engineering program, where I thrived under its rigorous curriculum. I quickly learned React, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, all while developing a problem-solving mindset that carried over to my technical support roles.`,
            // `I’ve been fortunate to use the skills I’ve learned in my SaaS technical support career, helping businesses troubleshoot and resolve complex issues. I’ve worked with APIs, debugging tools like Kibana, and ticketing systems like Zendesk and Salesforce to investigate problems, improve workflows, and ensure seamless customer experiences. Whether it's analyzing logs, debugging integrations, or simplifying technical concepts for users, I enjoy being the bridge between technology and people.`,
            // `Outside of work, I love playing video games, practicing mindfulness, hiking, working out, reading, and building silly little projects. I’m always looking for new ways to grow, whether it's through exploring new technologies or challenging myself with creative pursuits.`,
